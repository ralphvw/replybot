- Django Rest Framework 3.12 or higher
- OpenAI Python Library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the OpenAI API:

   - Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.
   - Set the API key as an environment variable in your system or update the `settings.py` file with your API key.

5. Start the development server:

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for interacting with the API:

- `POST /api/reviews/`: Receive customer reviews and generate sentiment-based replies.

## Usage

### Sending Customer Reviews
